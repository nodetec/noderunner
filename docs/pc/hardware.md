# Hardware

You will likely be able to run a Full Node on most semi-modern hardware. The requirements are not very high. 

You will need a drive with at least 1TB of storage available if you want to store the entire blockchain.

I will also recommend that you use a modern SSD for the IBD as it will speed up the process significantly (Days vs Weeks).

**Note:** I am working on collecting data on the ability of different hardware to run a Full Node. If you have any data to share, please let me know.
