# Node Runner

This site is broken up into a few different guides, if you're not sure where to start and already have a Personal Computer or Laptop I recommend starting in the [PC/Laptop](/pc) section.

If you are interested in a full DIY node setup then checkout the Raspberry Pi [4](/rpi4) & [5](/rpi5) guides and [Mini PC](/mini-pc) guide. Note that some technical ability and time will be required for those options.

And if you want a more out of the box experience with some nice bells and whistles you can checkout the [prebuilt](/prebuilt) node section where there are some links to companies who have their own guides for how to install their free and open source Node Server software and allow you to purchase nodes that are ready to go out of the box.
